        bio: [
            `Lord Laidlaw is a committed philanthropist, serial entrepreneur, 
        and accomplished sportsman. A graduate of Leeds University and Columbia  
        Business School, Lord Laidlaw founded the Institute for International Research Ltd (IIR) 
        which became the worldâ€™s largest conference and training company. He sold it in 2005 for $1.4bn to Informa Plc.`,

            `He has since gone on to build a large property company and invest extensively in sustainable energy, including the Veja Mate Offshore Wind Farm where he was the majority owner. His most recent project is building a renewable power resource in Rwanda.`,
            `Lord Laidlaw was one of the very earliest business leaders to see diversity in his management team as an important strength. His leadership team had a majority of women and members of the LGBTQ+ community. Lord Laidlaw believes passionately that performance should be rewarded and was a pioneer in sharing profits with his employees.`,
            `A committed internationalist, he considers it vital for the next generation of leaders to have and understand global connections. His generous philanthropy, 
            funding academies and scholarships, centres on two core beliefs; firstly that inspirational education can break the cycle of poverty, and secondly the need for a new generation of diverse, 
            passionate and adaptive leaders with a world view. The Women in Business movement that Lord Laidlaw funds, both helps to build a more diverse future leadership and pays tribute to the many 
            women who helped make IIR so successful.`,
